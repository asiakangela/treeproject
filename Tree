#TRESS
#A tree is a type of data structure that is often used to represent hierrarchical data.In computer science,
#trees grow downwardso the top of the tree uis the root.Each element on the tree is called a node.
#TYPES OF TREES
#GENERAL TREE: a tree is called a general tree when there is no constraint imposed on the hierrarchy of the tree.
#In a general tree, each node can have infinite number of children.
#BINARY TREES: these are special type of trees where nodes can only havetwo children.
#N-ary Tree: the maximum number of children a node can have is limited to N.
#Red-black tree, AVL tree and also the Binary search tree.
#Things to take note of:
#A node can only have one parent but multiple children
#Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes.
